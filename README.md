[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Silk-GUI/silk-electron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Silk-GUI/silk-electron)

This is a bridge between Silk and Electron to allow apps built with
electron run in Silk and apps made for Silk to run in Electron.

It tries to replicate the Electron API. Some of the finished API's currently only work on OSX.
